# SleepDeepNetwork
Deep Learning final project. Aims to replicate the study outlined in this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406978/

To run cloud_model.py, it takes three arguments:
1. directory to contain model subfolder and logs subfolder
2. class label settings (integer 2-6)
3. input data type (either 'fpz', 'eog', or 'both')

A sample command looks like this "python cloud_model.py ~/home/rshah98626/SleepDeepNetwork/ 6 fpz"
